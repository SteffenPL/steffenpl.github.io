# ⚖️ What is the right scale for modelling? 

I recently had an interesting discussion about modelling:
_Is it better to model on a micorscopic scale or on a kinetic or macroscopic scale?_

To give my answer right away: I don't know and most likely it depends on  the problem at hand.

So, to keep things in perspective, I will focus on cell migration.
A topic probably almost as old as biology itself and one of the 
prime examples of mathematical biology. 
The scale we are confronted with in cell biology range from
the size of individual cells (let's say a few $\mu m$) and 
a whole cell cluster might occupy a volume of $1000 \mu m^3$ to $1 mm^3$). Obviosuly, this is quite a large variance, and similarily, there
are also many possible modelling choices.

In the following I want to present two small *toy models* to reflect
