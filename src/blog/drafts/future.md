# Information overflow

## The status quo

In the last month I started extensively to use coding assistants not just as fancy auto-completes but as full-fledged authors of my programming tasks. 

Using Claude Code blew my mind and basically makes completion of some coding tasks at least 10x faster; in particular breaking through barriers of complexity in no time. This got me thinking, what we, the researchers, now need to focus on in order the sustainable be able of processing, checking, validating, advancing and using these tools.
