Speaker: **Grisha Szep (Henkaku Center, Chiba Institute of Technology)**
📘 Title: **Emergent locomotion with scalable cytoskeleton simulations in WebGPU.**

Abstract: Grisha Szep will present about real-time, interactive single-cell simulations in WebGPU, where active filaments self-organize into motile cytoskeletal structures. He will also introduce WebGPU and its potential for scalable, browser-based scientific simulations and computational art, connecting artificial life, microbial evolution, and open-ended exploration of emergent cellular behaviors. (Take a look at the simulator at [gszep.com/fluid-structure-interactive/cyto](https://gszep.com/fluid-structure-interactive/cyto).)

📅 Date: November 12 (Wed), 14:00
📍 Location: Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology (ASHBi-WPI),
Medicine Faculty Bldg. B, Seminar Room (1st floor)
