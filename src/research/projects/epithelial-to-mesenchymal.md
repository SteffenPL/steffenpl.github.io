_Short summary:_ During development, some epithelial cells differentiate further and perform the so-called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These cells gain more mobility and start to migrate. 
Since in vivo experiments are very challenging and restricted, we built a computational model 
to study which factors of EMT are most relevant.

_Disclaimer:_ This page should be considered as an informal description about what we do. 
Of course, the precise and detailed research will (hopefully) be part of an upcoming publication.
