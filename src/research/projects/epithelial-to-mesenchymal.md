_This project is a collaboration with:_  Eric Theveneau, Marina A. Ferreria, Diane Peurichard, Pierre Degond and Sara Merino-Aceituno.

Our goal is to study the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in particular we want to identify which
mechanical factors play a role (does the timing matter? how essential are protrusions?). 
An important aspect is the heterogenity of EMT:
Cells move
