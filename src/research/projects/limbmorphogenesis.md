*This project is a collaboration with [Rio Tsutsumi](https://ashbi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/rio-tsutsumi/){target="_blank"} and [Antoine Diez](https://antoinediez.gitlab.io/){target="_blank"} supported by the ASHBi Fusion Grant.*


We use mathematical models to understand how cell mechanics could explain symmetry breaking and elongation in Rio's limb-like organoid models.
