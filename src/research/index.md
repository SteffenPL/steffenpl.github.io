## Research interests

My mathematical research interests are

**Biomathematics and modelling:** {.m-0}
- Mechanical models for cell dynamics; agent-based models
- Developmental biology (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions)
- Actin-myosin dynamics
- Elasticity theory

**Numerics:** {.m-0}
- Geometric numerical methods (symplectic methods, finite element exterior calculus)
- Coupled systems and inequality constraints (differential inclusions, position-based dynamics)

**Kinetic theory:** {.m-0}
- Mean-field limits (in particular with constraints)


## Projects

_This section is still work in progress._
